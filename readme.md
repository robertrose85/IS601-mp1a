##Composer
Need to create a composer.json file

Each language has a dependency management system - for php it's composer. This will automatically maintain libraries for our application.

In terminal ->  echo '{}' > composer.json // This creates a composer file with curly braces inserted in the file.

In terminal -> git add composer.json // this tells git which file it is going to work with

In terminal -> git commit -m "add composer.json for PHP app detection"

## Procfile

Text file -> google heroku php procfile and look for specifying which webserver to use and setting doc root.
