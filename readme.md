##Composer
Need to create a composer.json file

Each language has a dependency management system - for php it's composer. This will automatically maintain libraries for our application.

In terminal ->  echo '{}' > composer.json // This creates a composer file with curly braces inserted in the file.

In terminal -> git add composer.json // this tells git which file it is going to work with

In terminal -> git commit -m "add composer.json for PHP app detection"

## Procfile

Text file -> google heroku php procfile and look for specifying which webserver to use and setting doc root.

web: vendor/bin/heroku-php-apache2 public/

Webserver Procfile text.

End: 57:30

## Branches

Go to VCS - Git - Create branches. In the lower right you can switch between branch and master.

COMMIT THE BRANCH and you can switch between the master app and the branch app.

Branching allows teams to work on their own versio of the master file and check work
separately. The merging appends the changes to the master file.

Merging branches into master will automatically commit.

##print_r vs echo
echo will print text, strings, numbers
print_r will print the object and the properties of the object
